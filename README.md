### Funk SVD from scratch

The notebook implements the FUNK SVD recommender algorithm using R.  The aims of which were to better understand the mechanistic aspects of this well known algorithm.

Full credit and appreciation to the [Matrix Factorization and Advanced Techniques](https://www.coursera.org/learn/matrix-factorization?specialization=recommender-systems) Coursera course which proved invaluable.
